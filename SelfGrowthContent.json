Where is that one?” “The same thing seems to have happened.”.“What do you think is the biggest waste of time?” “Comparing yourself to others,” said the mole.“I wonder if there is a school of unlearning”.“Most of the old moles I know wish they had listened less to their fears and more to their dreams.”.“What is that over there?” “It’s the wild,” said the mole “Don’t fear it.”.“Imagine how we would be if we were less afraid.”.“I’m not afraid,” said the mole. “If I wasn’t caught in this snare I’d kill you,” said the fox.“If you stay in that snare you will die,” said the mole. So the mole chewed through the wire with his tiny teeth.“One of our greatest freedoms is how we react to things”.“I’ve learned how to be in the present.” “How?” asked the boy “I find a quiet spot and shut my eyes and breathe.” “That’s good, and then?” “Then I focus.” “What do you focus on?” “Cake,” said the mole.“Isn’t it odd. We can only see our outsides, but nearly everything happens on the inside.”“Be careful not to fa . . .” . . . ll”.“So much beauty we need to look after.”.“Being kind to yourself is one of the greatest kindnesses,” said the mole.“We often wait for kindness . . . but being kind to yourself can start now,” said the mole.“Often the hardest person to forgive is yourself”.“Sometimes I feel lost,” said the boy. “Me too,” said the mole, “but we love you, and love brings you home.”",

It lasts longer.”.“Nothing beats kindness,” said the horse. “It sits quietly beyond all things.”.“Sometimes,” said the horse. “Sometimes what?” asked the boy. “Sometimes just getting up and carrying on is brave and magnificent.”.“How do they look so together and perfect?” asked the boy “There’s a lot of frantic paddling going on beneath,” said the horse.“The greatest illusion,” said the mole, “is that life should be perfect” my dog walked over the drawing – clearly trying to make the point.“Is it the moon?” asked the boy. “it’s a tea cup stain . . .” said the mole, “and where there’s tea there’s cake.”.Be curious.“Life is difficult but you are loved.”",
